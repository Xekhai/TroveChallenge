### Approach
An initial screen was made summarising what the app was about and its basic functionalties.
After proceeding, the login screen is encountered and from there, you can reset your password or create a new account.

Functional programming was used all through and react navigation was used to handle navigations.
The Home is where majority of the App functions happes. Loans can be taken, repaid and viewed on the Home screen. You can also fund your  account from the  homepage also.

Portfolio can be managed by clicking on the portfolio. From there you can add new assets or sell existings one. 

Back4app was used with PARSE api to give the app a dynamic feel. The dataase has an MS-Acess  like structure.
